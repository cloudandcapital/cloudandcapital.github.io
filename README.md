2) Upload everything in this folder to the repo root (keep `/resources` and `/pdfs`).
3) Go to **Settings → Pages** → Source: **Deploy from a branch** → Branch: `main` → Folder: `/ (root)` → Save.
4) Your site will appear at `https://cloudandcapital.github.io/`.

## Update
- Add new PDFs to `/pdfs/` and add a new card in `index.html`.
- Edit accent color in `resources/style.css` (`--accent`).
- Replace the logo at `resources/logo.svg` or swap with your own.
